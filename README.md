# Installation Scripts

In an effort to make installation of LightBit easier, we have compiled various installation scripts for different os distributions. Navigate to the os that you are using to view the appropriate documentation.

If your os or linux distribution is not present, feel free to submit a pull request or fill out a git issues so we can work to add it.
